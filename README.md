# Caffeine & Cacao website using Django Framework
Caffeine & Cacao Co.’s project is built using a modern, robust tech stack designed to create a seamless, engaging, and user-friendly experience for its customers. The project leverages a range of technologies, from frontend frameworks to backend infrastructure, to deliver an intuitive and dynamic online platform for coffee and chocolate enthusiasts. Here’s a breakdown of the tech stack:

1. Frontend Technologies
HTML5 & CSS3: The core structure and styling of the website are built using HTML5 for semantic markup and CSS3 for responsive, visually appealing designs. CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are used to ensure the site is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic user experiences, the project uses React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building single-page applications (SPAs). React’s component-based architecture allows for reusable UI components, improving development efficiency and consistency.
